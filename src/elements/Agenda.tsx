export default function Agenda() {
    // event code goes here

    return <section className="agenda">
        <h2>Agenda</h2>
        <h3>Date</h3>
        <p>Here is where the schedule would go, this entire section is pretty designy. The nice thing about React is that we can store the events in a JSON format, and then generate a UI for it instead of just creating an ugly list or table. It can be stored in the code, or maybe use something like Pastebin or GitHub and send a GET request.</p>
    </section>;
